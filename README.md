# Combining FSMs with Reinforcement Learning

This project was developed for a paper that studies manually programmed AI in combination with Reinforcement Learning for simulating non-player characters. This scenario is based on the [ML Agents Ecosystem](https://github.com/damasioj/ML-Agents-Ecosystem) used in a Master's thesis. It includes an agent that is manually programmed (no ML involved) for comparison purposes.

# Unity ML-Agents SDK

The project uses Unity ML-Agents to train agents.

# Goals

The following are the goals of this project:

- [x] Integrate a manually programmed agent
- [x] Ensure it works together with ML agents
- [ ] Code finalizing

# Requirements

To run this environment, you will need:
- Python 3.6.1 or greater
	- mlagents version 0.16.1
- Unity 2019.2.0f1 or greater

# Limitations and Observations

Todo. More can be found at the ML Agents Ecosystem [repository](https://github.com/damasioj/ML-Agents-Ecosystem).
